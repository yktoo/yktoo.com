Today I've run yet another half marathon (**21.1 km**), in the small town of {{< wiki "IJsselstein" "en" "Ijsselstein" >}}, which is near to Houten we live in.

The run was expectedly called [Ijsselsteinloop](http://www.ijsselsteinloop.nl/) ("Ijsselstein run").

This time my result of **1:49:01** didn't beat the record, but it was just a minute more than the [previous run at De Haar]({{< relref "/blog/0320" >}}). Which is not bad, considering sauna-like conditions and even a short rain-shower!

The outcome is the **123<sup>rd</sup>** place (out of **307**) among boys.

The organisation was pretty simple, with timing points at the start and at the finish only (and not every five kilometres like in {{< fl "De Haar" >}}), and no fences along the route. Thanks to that the price was only **â‚¬8** (instead of the usual 20-25 euros).

Numerous crossings our route was passing were supervised by the police, who would stop the traffic as soon as they saw someone approaching. That was the case even for a railroad crossing!
