Challenges chased me in my fatherland, and it takes time to recover. Anyway, imagine you were living in Russia. That's how you might see this, [according](http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/RU/NL) to IfItWereMyHome.com:

And let me comment on this:

 * Health care is indeed expensive here, but you don't want to experience Russian healthcare.
 * I'm not concerned about oil altogether.
 * Who cares about 0.75%?
 * As for the babies, they're very likely to live in the same country, at least until their majority, aren't they?
