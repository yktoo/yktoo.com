Even though this TV is a pricey, it doesn't stop Samsung from trying to earn even more on their customers. Selling accessories with a five hundred percent margin is a popular way to make money among vendors.

## Camera {#camera}

An [HDMI cable][post:243] isn't the only thing Samsung saved on. The TV is also lacking a camera out-of-the-box, which I definitely don't appreciate, considering numerous functions it's required for, like [Skype][post:246] or [Motion Control][post:244].

Furthermore, this TV would *only* recognise specific USB cameras by Samsung (the vendor recommends the model [VG-STC4000](http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/VG-STC4000/ZA)). Not only it's expensive (it costs about € 100), also finding it proved to be a challenge. I failed to find one in an online store, so eventually I bought the recommended model via eBay.

The camera is mounted on a knee-like stand with two joints, which allows securing it on the top edge of the TV at a desired pitch:

It's also equipped with a stereo mike and a mechanical shutter, which covers its watching eye when not in use, should you be worried about your privacy.

The maximal resolution is 1920×1080. The camera is used, among other things, for the following:

* Gesture recognition ([Motion Control][post:244]);
* Face recognition for signing into Samsung account;
* [Skype][post:246], both for video calls and face login;
* Virtual Mirror in fitness applications.

A blue LED indicates that the camera is active.

## One Connect Box (a.k.a. Evolution Kit) {#evolution-kit}

A bizarre device named *One Connect Box* or *UHD Evolution Kit*, model [SEK-2500U](http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/SEK-2500U/ZA) allows one to transfer all the TV connections onto this external box, whereas it only needs a single cable to connect itself to the TV.

{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Stoatsq183o/VQx5RMfV5BI/AAAAAAAAhS0/W7MaYipO_WE/s1600/Samsung-OneConnectBox.picasaweb.jpg" "Samsung SEK-2500U UHD Evolution Kit, front view." >}}

In addition to the same [connectors already available][post:244] on the TV, the Evolution Kit supports HDMI 2.0, [HDCP][wiki:en:High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection] 2.2 (Intel's version of DRM technology), the [MHL][wiki:en:Mobile_High-Definition_Link] 3.0 mobile AV interface and the H.265 codec (a.k.a. HEVC, which is already [available][post:247] in this TV).

The price tag is staggering four hundred euros.

## Smart Wireless Keyboard {#smart-wireless-keyboard}

[Samsung VG-KDB2000](http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/VG-KBD2000/ZA) is a regular Bluetooth keyboard, with a few Smart TV-specific labels and additional keys:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ge9Ll7-OmZU/VQs1ytBslBI/AAAAAAAAhSQ/iKTnI8Ju_XU/s1600/samsung_vgkbd2000.picasaweb.jpg" "Samsung VG-KBD2000 Bluetooth keyboard." >}}

It also features a tiny touchpad. The price is, like with the camera, about a hundred euros.

As I mentioned in the [previous part][post:244], the TV also supports standard USB and Bluetooth keyboards, but then you'll need to memorise that F8 is Pause and F2 is the "green" key.

## 3D glasses {#glasses-3d}

Out-of-the-box the TV has two pairs of active 3D glasses type [SSG-5100GB](http://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs-accessories/SSG-5100GB/ZA):
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YHEJ9q-HxqM/VQx6Z59qCUI/AAAAAAAAhTA/v-REjzaajig/s1600/Samsung-3D-glasses-SSG-5100GB.picasaweb.jpg" "Samsung SSG-5100GB 3D glasses." >}}

If you need more, you can by them at some 25 euros per pair. The glasses are active and require a CR2025 battery, which, according to Samsung, should last for 150 hours of operation. Before first use one has to assemble it, since the arms are detached from the body.

To switch the glasses on, you push the tiny white button at the top—the button lights green, and the TV displays a connection notification.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-elR_f-HRAM4/VVcyOBPa_rI/AAAAAAAAjcU/_Qmu5aLuAQA/s1600/dsc09505.picasaweb.jpg" "3D glasses connection notification." >}}

The viewing distance is two to six metres (6.6—20 ft) from the screen.

If you push the button again, the glasses turn off and the button turns red.

## Audio {#audio}

The TV can connect to Bluetooth headphones and external speakers. This is pretty straightforward and done via the Sound Settings menu. As soon as the connection is established, the internal speakers are automatically muted. Also the TV starts to ignore volume change and mute commands—it is assumed one should use Bluetooth device volume controls instead. Which is not always handy.

It can also send the audio to *Multiroom Link* compatible devices, such as soundbars and subwoofers. I don't have much to say in this regard as I'm only considering buying some at the moment, so more on this to follow.
