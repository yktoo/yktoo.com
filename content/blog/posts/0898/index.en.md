Are there too many "Comentario" posts in my blog?

Let’s change the subject for a moment. My New Year’s resolution for this year (what the Dutch call {{< fl "nieuwjaarsvoornemens" >}}) was to lose weight — specifically, to reduce my *visceral fat percentage while maintaining muscle mass*.

As you can see in the photo, the results speak for themselves. In numbers, I’ve gone from **87 kg** to **72 kg** (**-15 kg** or **-33 lb**) in body mass, and my visceral fat percentage has dropped from **13%** to **7%**.

I’m thrilled with the progress (also visible in the photo) — more details below.

## A Bit of Theory

First a bit of theory for those who are not very familiar with the terminology.

### About Fat

Body fat, officially called **adipose tissue**, serves as an energy reserve when food energy is insufficient. Conversely, it accumulates when there’s an energy surplus.

Fat in the human body is stored in three main "depots":

1. **Liver fat**: Minimal, around 200 g, but harmful when excessive, leading to hepatosteatosis ("fatty liver").
2. **Visceral fat**: Found around internal organs in the abdominal cavity. This is dangerous when excessive, raising inflammatory markers, impairing immunity, causing insulin resistance, and increasing cardiovascular risks. Reducing visceral fat improves overall health.
3. **Subcutaneous fat**: Found under the skin and the least harmful of the three, though still quite noticeable.

### Losing Weight

The only way to lose fat is by creating a **caloric deficit**: consuming fewer calories than you burn. Spot reduction is a myth; fat loss happens proportionally across the body, though rates vary by location.

### Muscle Mass Matters

Muscles aren’t just about aesthetics. Skeletal muscle mass is critical for overall health, with benefits such as:

* Enhancing physical condition and metabolism.
* Protecting joints and ligaments, reducing injury risk, and promoting proper posture.
* Acting as part of the endocrine system.
* Supporting bone density, especially in older age.

Important to know: muscle mass declines with age (a process called {{< wiki "sarcopenia" >}}), [starting](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9123344/) at **5%** per decade after **30** and accelerating later (to **1%** annually after **75**). Resistance training can largely counteract this, which is why maintaining or building muscle is crucial.

The importance of skeletal muscle mass is evident in its strong correlation with longevity and inverse correlation with all-cause mortality.

### Maximizing Lean Body Mass

For optimal health, you should aim to maximize {{< wiki "lean body mass" >}} (your body weight minus fat mass). However, building muscle while losing fat is challenging except for beginners. Most people must alternate between:

1. **Fat loss (cutting)**: Caloric deficit while minimizing muscle loss.
2. **Muscle gain (bulking)**: Caloric surplus while minimizing fat gain.

Strength training is essential during both phases to preserve muscle mass. Those relying solely on appetite-suppressing medications like Ozempic often lose both fat and muscle, with associated health risks.

## My Practical Experience

Here’s how my weight fluctuated {{< year 2024 "this year" >}}:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1735142958/blog/gjlvxsagdjpyxjtn17dl.svg" "My weight in 2024." >}}

Initially, I adopted a moderate food restriction approach: eating healthy, minimally processed, fiber-rich foods in moderation. By May, my weight had dropped from **87 kg** to **80 kg**. Then progress stalled.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1735151415/blog/cydk5lnfylecb3k05pbf.jpg" "My progress from February till December 2024." >}}

### Counting Calories

I had to toughen my restrictions in May. I began tracking calories using a free app called [Waistline](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waist.line). Setting a daily limit of **2200 kcal** (which is pretty low for my activity level of **5–6** weekly workouts) and cutting out almost all alcohol helped me break the plateau.

That **+2 kg** spike in late October? A week-long all-inclusive holiday in Egypt!

## Conclusions

While the constant hunger was challenging, the results were overwhelmingly positive:

* **Improved energy**: Even with severe calorie restrictions, I felt minimal fatigue and recovered quickly after overreaching.
* **Better health**: No illnesses. Ten years ago, even mild overreaching would leave me feverish.
* **Improved fitness**: Running is now easier, faster, and more enjoyable. I’ve shaved two minutes off my **10 km** time.
* **Financial benefits**: Quitting alcohol saves money (and boosted my immune system).
* **Compliments**: It’s motivating when strangers notice your progress!

### Better Sleep

Another pleasant surprise has been improved sleep quality:

* I've stopped relying on melatonin, entirely.
* Falling asleep now takes just **5–10** minutes.
* Seven hours of sleep feels restorative, compared to the **8.5–9** hours I previously needed.

## What's next

I consider my year-long weight loss experiment a success. Originally, I aimed to reduce visceral fat to **5–6%**, but pushing too hard in one go is counterproductive, as prolonged calorie restriction can lower metabolic rates and lead to other undesired effects on your health.

The literature suggests alternating between **3–4** month cutting and bulking phases, limiting weight changes to **10%** per phase.

Next month I'm switching from weight loss diet to weight maintenance, followed by a weight gain phase.
