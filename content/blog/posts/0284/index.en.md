And here we are, almost four months after the {{< a "0273" "exam" >}} I officially possess a Shodan Aikido Aikikai:
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yDzrlG5D55s/V40yhuRhIlI/AAAAAAAAmqw/-2izHWg62gYwt-aWnN5zlAvVc9TOVbujQCKgB/s1600/dsc02752.picasaweb.jpg" "Shodan certificate." >}}

The diploma has been solemnly granted by *Marc Jongsten* (who also took the exam) during a short ceremony at [Aikido Centrum Leiden](http://aikidoleiden.nl/).

Besides this—handwritten—certificate I was also given an official Hombu Dojo passport, instead of the former one, issued by the *DAF*:

This stuff is quite expensive I must say: {{< fl "shodan" >}} (first dan) costs **€ 125**, {{< fl "nidan" >}} (second dan) is **€ 175**.
