The fact this year has come to an end was a bit of a surprise for me. I remember myself in July and then—bang—it's Christmas and {{< fl "Sinterklaas" >}} is on his way. There's some explanation for that though, more on which below.

{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T0pGKdrZB1c/WkYeVgdD1vI/AAAAAAAArKQ/fa8g5Ol1jG0CaVB-u3_6G3gNvgj0mFp1wCKgBGAs/s1600/2018.png" >}}

And now it's time for the traditional annual round-up!

The last has brought major changes for the better for me, in contrast with the {{< a "0302" "gloomy 2016" >}}. I'll remember the following.

* I've celebrated the New Year's Eve in the French Lille.

I'm going to elaborate on that in a separate blog post.

* And, finally, the most important. The *circumstances* that changed my entire life. The most extraordinary person I've ever known has entered it in July. That was so intense that we've got matching tattoos one week into our relationship.

That was new for me, too.

<p class="text-center">
    <b>And on that note, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to wish you a cheerful and happy New Year!</b><br>
    Never give up and your dreams will eventually come true!

P.S. I'm writing these lines at a hotel in a village somewhere near German Rees. It's 14° C and sunny here. There's no one except us in the entire hotel.
