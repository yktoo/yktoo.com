The source code for **yktoo.com 3.0** is stable enough to be open for general public, which is something I was going to do from the beginning.

Today the code has been made available {{< a "https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com" "on GitHub" >}} and can be viewed, built, forked, {{< a "https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com/issues" "bug-reported" >}} upon etc.

{{< button "https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com" "<i class='fab fa-github bycon'></i>View on GitHub" >}}

So if you're curious how this all comes to existenceâ€”grab your chance!

## All you need is Hugo

Believe it or not, but building the website is utterly simple. You only need to {{< a "https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/" "install Hugo" >}}. Then just run `hugo` at the project root:

Or, you can use `hugo server` to bring up a local web server with a fully functional local copy of the site.

Enjoy the weekend!
