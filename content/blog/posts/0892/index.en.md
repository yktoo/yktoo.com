New version [Comentario **3.8.0 Belfast**](https://gitlab.com/comentario/comentario/-/releases/v3.8.0) is released.

[Comentario](/software/comentario) is a fast and powerful free comment server for web pages, written in Go.

## What's new

<!--more-->

### More Dashboard metrics

Dashboard now also displays total number of comments you've written, as well as the number of pages you commented on:

### Animated placeholders

If your website or network is slow, users will see animated placeholders indicating comment loading is in progress â€” instead of a blank page:

Hopefully you'll never see them, anyway. Comentario is, as you surely know, blazing fast.

### Transparent commenter login to Admin UI

On a page with comments, when you click on the gear (Settings) button and then on `Edit Comentario profile`, you don't need to log into the Admin UI anymore. This was previously necessary because your Admin UI is always on a different domain than the comments page, and every domain maintains its own session cookies.

The **3.8.0** release solves it by requesting a special single-use *authentication token*, which gets subsequently passed to the Admin UI web app and used there to log in.

### Version upgrade check

[Superusers](https://docs.comentario.app/en/kb/permissions/superuser/) (instance admins) will now see a notification badge in the sidebar, as well as a link to the latest release in the Static configuration, when a newer version is available:

This way you can stay up-to-date with the latest features and security updates.

### Startup error handling

When you're trying to open a comment page in a misconfigured environment and Comentario could not load, you'll see a clear message stating there's a problem, instead of a piece of some obscure JSON:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1716555148/blog/jgb5cvliwy5qlyyq3nd2.png" "Comentario failed to load." "border shadow" >}}

### Shared XSRF secret

In this version a new [secret](https://docs.comentario.app/en/configuration/backend/secrets/) key was introduced: `xsrfSecret`. If it's empty (the default), Comentario will generate a random key used to protect the Administration UI from CSRF (XSRF) attacks, like before.

When you provide a value, it will be SHA256-hashed and used as the XSRF key. Such a non-random secret value should be used in setups with multiple Comentario instances serving the same website; it would guarantee an XSRF token issued by one instance is accepted by another.

### Other changes

* Embed: disable toolbar on preview ([#93](https://gitlab.com/comentario/comentario/-/issues/93))
* Backend logging improvements:
    * log colouring and the `--no-color` CLI option to disable it
    * log times with millisecond precision
    * better formatting
* Add translation to Brazilian Portuguese (thanks to [Guilherme Alves](https://gitlab.com/behindsecurity))
* Dynamic config: disable images in markdown by default to mitigate possible identity attacks
* Fix: only support IPv4 in `signup_ip`/`author_ip` (works around [#95](https://gitlab.com/comentario/comentario/-/issues/95))
* Fix: also mask `author_ip`
* Fix: reset failed login counter on unlock ([#91](https://gitlab.com/comentario/comentario/-/issues/91))
