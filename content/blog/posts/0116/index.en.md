Our sports club has installed new treadmills, a quick googling showed it's [Matrix T7xe](http://www.matrixfitness.com/product/view/t7xe-treadmill). They are very trendy ones, pure high-tech:

It's the most advanced model, with buttons everywhere the creators just could place them. There's even an auxiliary black-and-white LCD (you can see it just above the red emergency stop switch):

15-inch resistive touchscreen gives you a lot of information:

This is how it looks like when running:

Among other things which any conventional treadmill would have, there's an iPod/iPhone connector. If you plug it in, you'll be able to control it with the device buttons. There's also a TV receiver (*Vista Clearâ„¢ digital ready television*), which I failed to start though (apparently the cable wasn't connected).

All in all it's much more amusing to jog now: my geek nature has a lot to stare at and to push on.
