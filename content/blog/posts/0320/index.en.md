Last Easter Monday I've completed my third *castlerun* [De Halve van De Haar](http://www.dehalvevandehaar.nl/), a half marathon (**21.1 km**) held in the park of the {{< fl "De Haar" >}} castle.

I'm pretty satisfied with my [result](https://evenementen.uitslagen.nl/2017/dehalvevandehaar/details.php?s=380), which is the best of all my runs so farâ€”**1:47:54**:

It's a significant improvement compared to the [Amersfoort]({{< relref "0279" >}}) (**1:55:04**) and the [previous De Halve]({{< relref "0274" >}}) (**2:01:46**) runs. It looks the trainings do make a difference after all!

The outcome is the **313<sup>th</sup>** place (out of 895) overall, **292<sup>th</sup>** place (out of 611) among men.

By the way, the places are assigned based on *gross* time (measured from the start shot) and not on *net* time (from the moment you cross the start line), which doesn't make sense. The start area is always crowded so it takes a while to reach the start line. It took me 33 seconds, for instance.

Anyway, [Ad Sluijter](https://evenementen.uitslagen.nl/2017/dehalvevandehaar/details.php?s=4), who took the first place, has finished half an hour ahead of me, so there's some room for growth!
