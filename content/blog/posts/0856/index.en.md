A while ago we [were](0765) happy **2020** came to an end. Two years on, in the hindsight I must admit we shouldn't have been complaining at all.

That said, all things eventually come to an end, even those appearing eternal. And it's time for a traditional upshot post.

There are quite a few pictures under the cut, as a compensation for my lack of activity in this blog throughout the past year.

<!--more-->

## January

My personal troubles predated those of my fellow Russians. My mother [passed](0802) on January 3<sup>rd</sup>. She was **87** and far from being healthy. I visited Russia for the funeral, which wasn't exactly an entertaining occasion.

That was happening against a backdrop of Russia's [preparing](0803) to invade Ukraine. An event hardly anyone in general public — Russians included — deemed possible back in the day.

## February

In early February I've [run **20 km**](ru;0808) while having COVID, simply because I wasn't aware of that. That proved to be an interesting experience.

On February **18** I've witnessed the wind level **8** (Beaufort scale) on my [InfoPi](/software/infopi) screen, which corresponds to an average wind speed of **17-20 m/s**. The cause was the storm Eunice.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672339895/blog/kultfghemhrvn9ukrvu9.jpg" "Ураган Eunice: ветер силой 8 баллов." >}}

And on February **24**, as we all known, Russia has turned a new page in its history. There's a lot said about that, and even more to come, so I'm going to pass here. I remember following the news feeds all day in real-time — Meduza, Twitter, Telegram — and that was gruelling.

At the end of the month we've been to {{< fl "Den Bosch" >}} (a.k.a. {{< fl "Oeteldonk" >}}) carnival, which brought us mixed feelings because of all what's been happening in Ukraine.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672340444/blog/drg8nxzj84qljp5qwide.jpg" "Oeteldonk carnival. February 2022." >}}

What a stark contrast the playful carnival images were with the hellish footage of Ukrainian cities under Russian shelling. We expected Kiev would go down in a few days.

## March

I March my wife has finally got an e-bike, something she was long time dreaming of. She can now easily cycle **25 km/h**, even in high heels.

It was also in March that it became clear Kiev wouldn't go down any time soon.

## April

On April 1<sup>st</sup> the nature made a good joke by [covering](0820) the blooming trees with snow.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/qc6y0ejbthlkdtnblw92.jpg" "April snow in Houten." >}}

On that same day we [released](https://docs.once.to/en/blog/0025/) a major update to [once.to](https://once.to/once). The most notable change was support for team work on links and statistics.

We visited Cologne, Germany, in the Easter. The weather was perfect and the city beautiful; the only issue was that almost everything was closed during those days.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672410774/blog/fqam3ytjuya56lilqaop.jpg" "Cologne, a view on the Rhine river from Köln Triangle." >}}

A week later we flew over to Portugal for the spring holidays, and stayed there until early May. We've visited lots of places in Porto (the origin on the same-named wine) and Lisbon, the capital.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672411296/blog/ya6loivwxofkvwlorlyw.jpg" "The Douro embankment in Porto." >}}

I'll remember that trip by the warm weather, hilly landscapes, Portugese wine, azulejo tiles and the distinct atmosphere of the old Europe.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672411620/blog/wn89x1upjj94cbnonssx.jpg" "The \"Pink street\" in Lisbon." >}}

On out way back from Lisbon to Porto we randomly visited {{< fl "Bacalhôa Buddha Eden" >}}, an incredibly beautiful place, with numerous sculptures, hundreds of sheet-iron animals, a bamboo grove etc. It's heavily underrated in my view.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672412068/blog/nvjrzodglhdxysw2skob.jpg" "Bacalhôa Buddha Eden in Portugal." >}}

## May

In early May our family was [expanded](0828) by a Bengal cat called Cheetah. She was lean and slender, and we weren't aware that she in fact was pregnant.

Mid-May I've had my first ever hot air balloon ride. I received it as a present a couple of years ago, but the ride was postponed several times because of the COVID pandemic and bad weather.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672412942/blog/k5nkjti2zeeqvxhxsay7.jpg" "Houten from a balloon." >}}

About the same time our almost-six-years-old daughter took part in {{< fl "Avondvierdaagse" >}}, an evening four-day walk. It's a kids version of the "real" annual {{< fl "Vierdaagse" >}}, during which adults walk **50 km** per day, four days in a row (totalling **200** kilometres). Since that's a bit too much for children, they usually walk only five km in the evening, hence the name. It's an optional Students from all schools in town take part if they wish, and there are usually a lot of participants — only in Houten perhaps more than a thousand.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672413559/blog/he6sp1du0pggbpn8bxl2.jpg" "Avondvierdaagse in Houten." >}}

In the end of May I got injured by spraining my ankle in a trampoline park. That was pretty bad, so that I could even step on it during the next week.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672413946/blog/wrobgzahrtbl4b5wtarw.jpg" "The author climbing a wall right before the accident." >}}

That was a mishap that caused a month-long break in my running schedule, not to mention my aikido trainings. After that month I could run only **5 км**, and came back to twenty only in early July. The ankle is almost completely recovered now, more than half a year later.

## June

In June I [won](0832) a first prize in my life, a digital DAB radio.

Another June highlight was visiting {{< fl "DEPOT" >}} in Rotterdam. The name's a kind of pun: {{< fl "depot" >}} and {{< fl "de pot" >}} (like a flower pot the building resembles). It's essentially an art depot, which is displaying (some) works at the same time. As I was told, the total value of the works in DEPOT is about **€ 8** billion.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672414616/blog/jsz1cry3uijw3xwyhhgj.jpg" "DEPOT Rotterdam." >}}

In the end of June our Cheetah gave birth to four kittens: three boys and a girl.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672414616/blog/yxepvyzphsyrrvhn36yz.jpg" "Newborn kittens and the mother." >}}

We sold three of those and kept one. He's got the name {{< fl "Shmel'" >}} ("Bumblebee" in Russian). He looks very much like his mother, and is gradually approaching her size:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672415270/blog/hklizfr9zh52tvhcqvw4.jpg" "Cheetah and Shmel'." >}}

## July

Most of July we spent in Alanya, Turkey. That was hard: some **40 °C** every day, and it was impossible to stay outside. And if you go to the seaside, you definitely need a cover. All in all, it's a very touristic place, and not in a nice way: there's literally nothing to do except lying down on the beach. As for attractions, you could see all of them in a few days.

The Red Tower, {{< fl "Kızıl Kule" >}}, is worth mentioning though:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672415862/blog/vxgiltw6nrszkcypawqh.jpg" "The Red tower, Alanya, Turkey." >}}

On our way back we stayed a dey in Antalya, a much larger city. I liked it much better there: more bars, restaurants, stores, foreigners; more life, in other words.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672416258/blog/ymo5zbhlxkiaitpgsswl.jpg" "Antalya, Turkey." >}}

## August

In August I restarted my powerlifting workouts in {{< fl "Basic Fit" >}}. Last time I paid some serious attention to weight lifting was in Russia back in **2008**. And, I must say, it worked out!

Then I had COVID, for the third time already, with very mild symptoms.

We spent another weekend in another German place: Münster, a beautiful old city.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672416691/blog/hjsznycda7m9torfgjpm.jpg" "The sand people of Münster and I." >}}

## September

To avoid any more surprises, we've had our Cheetah sterilised in September. She immediately started putting on weight and is now probably double the original size.

I got a present from my wife, the *Kangoo Jumps*, which is quite a peculiar thing. It isn't that hard to start with, but pretty challenging in terms of physical demand. A perfect means of staying fit!

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672422904/blog/mcnpnf1xurvfez3wjbrw.jpg" "Me wearing the Kangoo Jumps." >}}

It's a tradition for us to visit the {{< fl "Efteling" >}} attraction park in September. It's great fun for kids, the only downside are the enormous queues.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672417148/blog/fcpuchajzf4zxtvjztkv.jpg" "Efteling." >}}

Also, we've seen {{< fl "Cirque du Soleil" >}} live for the first time. They made an amazing show, I particularly liked the way they let the music to direct the show.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672417696/blog/fqlofimi5mbj5mgxl9vz.jpg" "Cirque du Soleil at Rotterdam Ahoy." >}}

## October

The autumn holidays we've spent on Crete, Greece. The island is huge and has a lot to see. And the weather in late October is perfect: some **23-25 °C**, you can even swim if you like. A great lace for hiking, delicious food, friendly people.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672418308/blog/wi4itbee7zwod2k6ze4e.jpg" "The Kritsa gorge, Crete, Greece." >}}

It also has lots of churches and И уйма церквей и monasteries. I'm not that much into religious architecture, but some thing did impress me.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672418583/blog/oukik9gc9irr935nu5vf.jpg" "The Agios Nektarios church, Malia, Crete." >}}

We liked Chania a lot, it's beautiful even in bad weather.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672418818/blog/vwf9xerambww72szkxju.jpg" "Chania, Crete." >}}

## November

My major November achievement was "smart" staircase lighting, which goes on when someone approaches it. It took me full two days of work, but my perfectionism was satisfied upon completion.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672420055/blog/bbzbunhdr2dcuto77hal.gif" "Smart staircase lighting." >}}

Oh, and also we've *almost* quit drinking alcohol after listening to a [podcast](https://yktoo.me/nM448E) by Andrew Huberman on alcohol effects on human's body and health.

## December

December was traditionally full of Christmas and New Year's Eve preparations: [Sinterklaas](/glossary/sinterklaas), Xmas parties etc.

We spend the Christmas period itself in the French Alps ({{< fl "Les Arcs" >}}), in the magic of snow riding and mountains.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672421146/blog/noswtgt3wr4wk6if8f6e.jpg" "Aiguille Rouge (3226 m), Les Arcs, France." >}}

## The bottom line

So here's a summary of my year in numbers and facts:

* A total of **901 km** running. It's less than the [year before](0801), but not so bad considering my injury which prevented me from running during a whole month.
* I managed to recover my strength and make **135 kg** in a bench press. That was exactly my record of **15** years ago, and I'm not stopping there!
* **55** Russian, **18** English, and **5** Dutch posts.
* Three [Ymuse](/software/ymuse) version, a [Flathub](0831) listing, also it [will](0851) be available in the upcoming Ubuntu version and, likely, in Debian too.
* Two versions of [Sound Switcher Indicator](/software/sound-switcher-indicator).

That's about it, I think.

**Happy New Year everyone!**

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1672338438/blog/roj0mr6uxdszss2i0h1a.jpg" >}}

Let the new year bring peace to Ukraine!
