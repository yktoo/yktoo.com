The website **yktoo.com** is permanently switched to using the secure {{< wiki "HTTPS" "en" "HTTPS" >}} protocol (instead of the former {{< wiki "HTTPS" "en" "HTTP" >}}). Your boss won't be able to figure out what exactly you're reading in my blog anymore.

There's an automatic redirect set up from **http://yktoo.com** to **https://yktoo.com**, but you may still need to update some links, like the {{< a "/blog/subscribe" "RSS feeds" >}}, for example.
