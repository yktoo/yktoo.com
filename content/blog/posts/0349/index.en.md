We're four days into a [record-breaking]({{< relref "0229" >}}) heatwave here. An "orange alert" ({{< fl "code oranje" >}}) has been declared in almost every province of the Netherlands:

The **75 years** old absolute temperature record established back in 1944 has been broken yesterday.

KNMI, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, first [reported](https://twitter.com/KNMI/status/1154362572138852354) the reading of  **41.7 °C** in the town of {{< fl "Deelen" >}}, but [refuted](https://twitter.com/KNMI/status/1154372338806398976) the measurement later.

The current official heat record was registered yesterday, 25 July 2019, in {{< fl "Gilze-Rijen" >}} and equals **40.7 °C**:

The air temperature has surpassed the 40 degrees mark in many places yesterday. This has never happened before.

The previous record of **38.6 °C** was [established](https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/nieuws/nationaal-hitterecord-na-75-jaar-verbroken) on 23 August **1944**.

Fans and air conditioners in most stores are sold out. There was a very similar situation exactly one year ago. Then the heatwave stayed longer although it was a little bit cooler. I seem to have bought the last airco in the country back then.

Luckily, the air should start to cool down tomorrow.
