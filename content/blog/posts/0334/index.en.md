It's been exactly ten years since I've {{< intref "0001" "moved" >}} to the Netherlands. And it's been an eventful time!

<!--more-->

I didn't question this decision ten years ago, nor do I have any regrets now. A man gets used to things over time, especially good ones.

As I look back on this ten-year stretch of my life curve, I realise it's been an everyday struggle. Mainly with myself, occasionally with someone else. What matters is that at this very point of the curve I feel happier than ever.

Mostly because my current aspirations match my possibilities, and I manage to use the latter, slowly but surely. I'm surrounded by people who care about me and whom I want to care about.

When I came to the Netherlands on April 3, 2008, I could barely link English words into a sentence. I found many things unusual or scary. These days I feel I'm coming home when I arrive in Holland. Once you've got the hang of this lively, international atmosphere, you get so used to it that you can hardly imagine otherwise.

Since that day I've properly learned English and Dutch ~~and forgot Russian~~, found new friends, several times switched jobs, residence and marital status, bought an own house, started this blog, and registered an own business.

That's why I also wish you to never give up, prioritise important things in life, be persistent and press ahead. And, most importantly, enjoy the process, because:
