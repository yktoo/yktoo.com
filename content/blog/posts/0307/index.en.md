With all that fuss I have missed the important date of **20 years** of my professional experience, which happened on March 22, 2016.

It reads: *"March 22, 1996: Hired as a principal engineer of IT department at the Siberian Branch of the National Public Library for Science and Technology"*. One might wonder how a student with no professional experience could have been hired as a principal enginer. The thing is, at those chaotic times a construction worker might be paid a higher salary than a university professor. In order to motivate me my future boss had offered me the highest available position at the department.

And I was indeed motivated. Nonetheless, one year later (the record No. 2 on the scan above), after my graduation, I had to quit to return to my home city Tyumen.

To mark this anniversary I have made a graphical story of my professional path (as frantic as it looks):
