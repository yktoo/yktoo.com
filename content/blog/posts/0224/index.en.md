Even though I've now settled in {{< a "0221" "Houten" >}}, I keep visiting Amersfoort now and then. I'm still {{< a "0011" "doing aikido" "ru" >}} with Joginder Singh.

On September 7<sup>th</sup> our dojo gave a demo on a "district day" [Vathorstdag 2014](http://www.vathorstdag.nl/) ({{< fl "Vathorst" >}} is the district in Amersfoort our dojo is in), just like {{< a "0026" "six years ago" "ru" >}}.

I didn't participate this time, but was filming instead. There was also another cam, so the idea was to put both footages together nicely, and I volunteered for that.

I've tried a number of video editors for Linux, most of them proved to be utterly unusable ([Pitivi](http://www.pitivi.org/) wouldn't allow me to edit track properties, [OpenShot](http://www.openshot.org/) lacked the very basic timeline shift function, [Shotcut](http://www.shotcut.org/) quit abruptly after adding a clip, [Kino](http://www.kinodv.org/) is discontinued long time ago). Finally I've tried [Kdenlive](http://www.kdenlive.org/), and that one is absolutely fantastic! I was surprised how quick and hassle-free video editing can be nowadays. All in all it took me about a couple of hours, including the final render.

The result is under the cut:
