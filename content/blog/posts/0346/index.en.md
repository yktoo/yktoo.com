It's been almost three years since the first incarnation of the Yktoo Solutions website has seen the light. That first version has been built on a technology stack similar to my "flagship" website [yktoo.com](https://yktoo.com/), i.e. the good old LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).

As we were planning to extend our operation, a new representation on the web was necessary.

There was also another wish, to implement a proper news feed or, rather, a blog, that would inform the general public of current developments and, at the same time, provide some useful technical insights (of which we have plenty).
