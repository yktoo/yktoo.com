Finally I got to create a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/yktoo/yktools) for all my public domain utility tools (I had to fiddle quite a while with `git filter-branch` to extract all the 'safe for public' stuff from my home repo).

At the moment the following four scripts are available:

<!--more-->

* `generate-wallpaper-xml`
    <p></p>
    [Creates an XML]({{< relref "0168" >}}) wallpaper file with a slide show.

* `picasa-upload`
    <p></p>
    [Advanced picture uploader]({{< relref "0110" >}}) for Google Picasa, capable of watermarking images.

* `rotate-wallpaper`
    <p></p>
    [A simple script]({{< relref "0122" >}}) that sets a random image as current wallpaper.

* `update-exif-date`
    <p></p>
    Updates EXIF date in JPEG images according to the file name.
