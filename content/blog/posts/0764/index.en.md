Yesterday, **28** December **2020**, about **21:00** Moscow time, you left us.

Another priceless life taken by COVID-19. We're still deeply shocked by how fast this tragedy unfolded. Less than a month ago you were perfectly sane and strong, albeit somewhat tired.

Then you were hospitalised into the Nikolayev hospital, whose hotline would repeatedly report a "good and steady progress" on you. Two weeks later you were dismissed from the hospital, but no one cared to explain to us you'd suffered **60%** lung damage and still had developing pneumonia.

After that you spent a few days at home, weakening and fading, almost speechless, until we realised something was terribly wrong. Then we rushed you to a private hospital, for there was no single spot available in any of the regular ones.

We were told you were in a very, very poor condition. They gave you at most ten days. You managed to live eight.

You were just four months short of your **85**. You passed away on the darkest day of the grimmest year. You went in peace and without pain. Perhaps, the best way to go.

You taught me everything I know. You were unparalleled in perseverance, meticulousness, and patience. You've been doing you morning exercises daily since you were **16**. You once told me you trained your endurance by forbearing to eat and drink.

You've always been on the move. You left Kherson for Siberia in the **1960**'s. Then, in the eighties, we moved to Tyumen. Then, on the break of the new millennium, to Belgorod. And, finally, to Peterhof four years ago.

You defended your Ph.D. thesis in **1980**, then the well-earned doctoral thesis in **1992**. I remember how proud you were of that achievement. You've written a few books, with the latest being the [course of physics](https://www.labirint.ru/books/697936/) published last year. A decade ago you asked me to make a [website on paradoxes of electromagnetic induction](http://electrodynamics.narod.ru/). To be honest, I can barely comprehend things it explains.

You never complained, even when everything would go haywire. You only regretted you didn't get great-grandchildren. You'd never say an unnecessary word or ask an unnecessary question. And we could always rely on you, without a doubt.

We're feeling sad and devastated at the moment. On the other hand, I think I'm lucky since *this* is the worst thing ever happened to me. Of course, it's inevitable. And the life carries on, only without you.

Farewell, my beloved dad, the stubbornness champion. Rest in peace.
