I've found recent [aerial footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oaoxth-jT7w) of Houten, the town we're [living](/series/houten) in, shot in **4K** with a DJI Mini 3 Prop.

It's a quality little film showing the main highlights and characteristic places in Houten.

However, I'd actually like the video at a slower pace better, so that the details would be easier to make out.
