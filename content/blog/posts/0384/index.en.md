Today I've received a parcel from the almighty AliExpress. A pretty puzzling one.

You'd be puzzled, too. What do you think an "inflatable treasure" is?

I have to admit, it's a very good looking one. One might confuse it for a music player. I'm going to write a review after having used it for a while.
