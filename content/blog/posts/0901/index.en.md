For the February break, we once again embarked on our annual pilgrimage to the slopes: this year's choice fell on the French **La Plagne**.

Below, you’ll find a short **4K** video showcasing a week of tumbling, face-planting (nah…), and occasionally even snowboarding, plus a handful of photos that prove we did more than just lie in the snow contemplating our life choices.

## The Journey: A Test of Patience and Battery Life

Getting there was an adventure in itself, mostly spent sitting in traffic and questioning our life decisions. Predictably, the closer we got to the mountains, the more everything slowed to a crawl—kind of like a poorly optimized video game. Special shoutout to electric car owners, who got to enjoy both traffic jams and long queues at charging stations. Double the fun!

On the way back, though, we pulled off a genius move: we left at **3 AM**, zoomed down the mountain like escaped criminals, and made it home by **3 PM**, feeling like tactical masterminds (and also like we needed a nap).

## The Weather: A Game of "Guess What’s Falling From the Sky?"

This time, *Mother Nature* decided to keep us on our toes. For most of the trip, we got a lovely mix of overcast skies, snow, blizzards, and fog thick enough to make you question whether you were snowboarding or just starring in a low-budget horror film. Only the last day and a half graced us with sunshine—just long enough for us to remember what color the sky is.

Here’s a ten-minute video featuring only the moments where we didn’t immediately wipe out:

## The Slopes: Still the MVP

Despite the weather’s best efforts, La Plagne never lets us down. The snow here is treated better than elsewhere, always in top condition. And thanks to the resort’s altitude (**2,000 m** and up), there’s always plenty of it—no sketchy patches of ice, just fluffy, snowboarder-approved powder.

And now, enjoy some epic photos—many featuring clouds hanging so low, it felt like they were just trying to join in on the fun:
