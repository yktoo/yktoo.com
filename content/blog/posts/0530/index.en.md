The time flies by so fast, it's hard to believe so much has happened during the last year!

Looks like it's time for yet another {{< a "/tags/upshot" "upshot" >}} post?

I'll start with the most significant one: last July the most special woman {{< a "0345" "has become my wife" >}}, which we then celebrated in Cannes in September.

During {{< year 2019 "this year" >}} I have also:

* Worked **1836** hours as a freelancer;
* Discovered and learned {{< a "https://gohugo.io/" "Hugo" >}}, {{< a "0351" "reimplemented" >}} this blog and moved {{< a "0452" "to Cloudinary" >}} for media storage;
* Written **186** posts {{< a "/blog/archive" "in Russian" "ru" >}}, **59** {{< a "/blog/archive" "in English" >}} (this one included), and **9** {{< a "/blog/archive" "in Dutch" "nl" >}}, as well as **25** {{< a "/glossary" "Glossary" >}} terms;
