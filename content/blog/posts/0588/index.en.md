It's Friday again! This tenth edition of {{< a "/series/musicellaneous" "Musicellaneous" >}} features another unique project by a talented individual. I'm talking about the instrumental progressive metal band {{< a "https://andromidaofficial.com/" "Andromida" >}}, which is in fact just one person: the American **Ramon Gutierrez**.

The band is unique because Ramon is "legally blind", which was discovered when he was as little as three years old.

According to the {{< a "https://andromidaofficial.com/" "band's official page" >}}, the musician started learning violin at the age of three and guitar when he was eleven. He was supervised by a teacher when learning violin, but guitar he has completely learned himselfâ€”and, naturally, by ear.

Which is hard to believe if you watch his videos:

## Music

Nearly all tracks by **Andromida** are instrumental save for a couple of songs featuring guest vocalists (*Crawling*, *Take What You Want*).

The tracks' names are all related to space, which, along with the music itself, closely reminds me of *Sithu Aye* and *Widek*. The sound is dense and heavy, featuring typical djent rhythms. It's a remarkably quality work, so my kudos to Ramon, both as a musician and as a producer.

## Discography

**Andromida** is also strikingly prolific. It has released as many as five albums and a dozen singles in the last three years.
