{{< a "http://tomhegen.de/" "Tom Hegen" >}}, a German award-winning photographer specialising in aerial photography, has made absolutely stunning night photos of the Netherlands.

They feature dazzling light patches of greenhouses against the pitch-black background, so bright that they are clearly visible from space.

By the courtesy of Tom I'm publishing his {{< a "http://tomhegen.de/fotodesign/the-greenhouse-series/" "Greenhouse Series" >}} photos in my blog today.

## The Greenhouse Series

The Netherlands is the world's **number two** exporter of agricultural produce, second only to the United States, which has **270** times its land mass.

This incredible result is achieved by implementing the most advanced technology in farming and agriculture, as well as by heavy optimisation of the processes.

One example of that are LED-lit greenhouses, round the clock growing fruits and vegetables.

This has obviously a very positive impact on the national economy and the food availability, but it also comes at a cost.

For instance, the lighting and heating of the greenhouses are very energy-consuming. Another example is the {{< wiki "light pollution" >}} caused by that.

But I have to admit: in the dark it does look splendid.

I also highly recommend Tom's {{< a "http://tomhegen.de/" "website" >}} and {{< a "https://www.instagram.com/tomhegen.de/" "Instagram" >}}, there are plenty of other beautiful works by the photographer.
