The turbulent two thousand sixteen has come to an end. The year that has brought so much grief to our world. The year in which {{< a "0283" "Sun Caged" >}} and *Stream of Passion* ceased to exist. I'm inclined to think it's good that it's over.

<p class="text-center">
    <b>Happy <big>2017</big> to all the readers of this blog! I wish you lots of optimism, persistence and luck!</b>

Following the tradition I'd like to look back on the last year—which has been quite positive on my part. So, in **2016** I managed to:

<!--more-->

* Learn how to {{< a "0270" "snowboard" >}}.
* Begin to routinely run **20** km, and got so used to it that my run for this year has totalled exactly **1000** kilometres (that is, a megametre). Up to this moment my best result on a twenty-kilometre distance is one hour and fourty-four minutes.
* Lost about ten kilos, partially thanks to running.
* Have run two half marathons (**21.1 km**): one in {{< a "0274" "De Haar" >}} and the {{< a "0279" "Amersfoort" >}} one.
* Finally obtain the {{< a "0273" "first dan" >}} in aikido aikikai, as well as the corresponding {{< a "0284" "certificate" >}}.
* Follow private Dutch lessons.
* Add Dutch to this website and translate a {{< a "/blog/archive" "few posts" "nl" >}} as an additional exercise to the previous item.
* Take some important career steps:
    * Have many job interviews in Dutch.
    * Register my own sole proprietorship company [Yktoo Solutions](http://www.yktoo.solutions/) in the Netherlands (more on this subject later) and create a [website](http://www.yktoo.solutions/) in the new shiny `.solutions` domain.
    * As a consequence, digest a lot of information about taxation rules, accounting etc., as well as visit numerous related events.
    * *Almost* become a freelancer (which is currently a bit delayed due to the holiday period).
* Visit many interesting destinations:
    * {{< a "0270" "Sölden and Längenfeld" >}} (Austria)
    * Bruges (Belgium), perhaps for the tenth time
    * the Corfu island (Greece)
    * the Mosel wine region (Germany)
    * {{< a "0287" "St Petersburg" >}}
    * {{< a "0292" "Brussels" >}} (Belgium)
    * {{< a "0299" "London" "ru" >}}
    * Liege (Belgium)
    * Lille (France), where I'm writing this
* Build my first smart home version based on *Raspberry Pi*, *Z-Wave*, *Philips Hue*, and *RFXtrx*.
* Develop the {{< a "0278" "InfoPi" >}} system as a part of that smart home.
* Modify my 75-inch TV by {{< a "0280" "adding backlight" >}} without breaking the whole thing.
* See with my own eyes:
    * {{< a "0272" "Dream Theater" >}} at {{< fl "Carré" >}}.
    * {{< a "0283" "Sun Caged" >}} & Co at {{< fl "De Bosuil" >}}.
    * *Plini*, *Intervals*, and *Animals as Leaders* at {{< fl "Patronaat" >}}.
    * *Stream of Passion* at {{< fl "P60" >}}, for the last time.
    * {{< a "0296" "Shadowrise and Myrath" >}} at {{< fl "Patronaat" >}}.
    * *Crisálida*, *Imperial Age*, *Voodoo Kungfu*, and *Orphaned Land* at {{< fl "Baroeg" >}}.
    * {{< a "0292" "Moriteru Ueshiba" >}}, the grandson of the founder of aikido.
* And last but not least, finally learn to fold T-shirts like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyqltFTug1I)!

In the upshot, 2016 has become a year of the Dutch language and entrepreneurship for me. And there's definitely more to follow!
