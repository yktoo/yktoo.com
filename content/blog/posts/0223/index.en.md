In the [previous part]({{< relref "0222" >}}) I mentioned the "Bike Town" award given to Houten a few years ago. This tiny geographical object has also won a number of other awards:

<!--more-->

* The [fourth place](http://www.dichtbij.nl/lekstroom/regionaal-nieuws/artikel/3415489/houten-beste-gemeente-om-te-wonen.aspx) in the "Top Municipalities 2014" rating by the newspaper [De Telegraaf](http://www.telegraaf.nl/). 431 Dutch municipalities were assessed based on house prices, crime rate, wages and social infrastructure (shops, educational and healthcare institutions etc.).
* "Model Municipality" in the [Canon van de ruimtelijke ordening](http://www.canonro.nl) ([PDF document](http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/bestanden/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/10/28/35-iconen-van-ruimtelijke-ordening-in-nederland/ro-35-icons.pdf)) catalogue. This document provides the most impressive examples of town planning in Holland between 1940 and 2015.
* "Street Litter Fighter 2012" ([ZwerfAfvalPakker van het jaar](https://www.houten.nl/nieuws/bekijk/archief/2012/maart/artikel/gemeente-houten-winnaar-zwerfafvalpakker-2012/)).
* "Best Municipality for Kids 2009" ([Leukste gemeente voor kinderen](https://www.houten.nl/nieuws/bekijk/archief/2009/mei/artikel/houten-leukste-gemeente-voor-kinderen/)) in the "Children in Numbers" ([Kinderen in Tel](http://www.kinderenintel.nl/)) rating. The ranking created by [Verwey-Jonker Instituut](http://www.verwey-jonker.nl/) was based on infant mortality, number of teenage mothers, youth unemployment and so on.

In other words, there's something to be proud of for {{< fl "Houtenaars" >}}. Let's see what distinguishes Houten from other Dutch cities.

## Old Houten {#old}

{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bBt-dPzYMUU/U_uLTtKwcpI/AAAAAAAAfFA/CK20pVWHIo4/s1600/dsc06429.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

Even though our house is in the new part of the town, I really like the old, green, half.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U_Ke2GpIRwQ/U_uLBO9mDBI/AAAAAAAAfIA/VE7P8GNJDH8/s1600/dsc06386.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

The old town is crossed by a canal, which has about fifty bridges over it.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bwpf74xg3u8/U_uLB1bFe5I/AAAAAAAAfBc/6dLPKA57tok/s1600/dsc06387.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

It gets especially picturesque in the sunny weather.
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FJpibthxYBw/U_uLT72HTkI/AAAAAAAAfIk/j6tSHCEW1O0/s1600/dsc06430.picasaweb.jpg" >}}
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j5L-5OsjwGc/U_uLUQ0A6TI/AAAAAAAAfFM/IIeR2UtBHvs/s1600/dsc06431.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

A bench in the shape of the word "HERE" ({{< fl "HIER" >}}) is apparently only used by birds:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Je8zUMbHpVw/U_uLUun2Y9I/AAAAAAAAfIk/EkHBKozH7CM/s1600/dsc06432.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

There are plently of them, just like anywhere in Holland:
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S72PUtP_pBA/U_uLK9YvXQI/AAAAAAAAfIk/38FGztdUTjE/s1600/dsc06410.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

But we, Siberian folk, get most delighted about public fruit trees.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6k6XUFPLgU4/U_uLDkllESI/AAAAAAAAfGI/YJXGOgJUuCQ/s1600/dsc06391.picasaweb.jpg" >}}
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7RzQU7T0NuM/U_uLEiQwAyI/AAAAAAAAfBw/_HqOQUveiNc/s1600/dsc06392.picasaweb.jpg" >}}
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZwQcOoWerw/U_uLE1yiEVI/AAAAAAAAfI0/5FmKJ7P9sT4/s1600/dsc06393.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

The apples on them are as big as *real* French ones you find in the shop:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lBR46zxhDuw/U_uLC6oI_yI/AAAAAAAAfBY/Y37q1XMhmhw/s1600/dsc06389.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

And so are pears:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W_0xbF7zc-c/U_uLWygttmI/AAAAAAAAfIk/L6MvAXGpYDo/s1600/dsc06438.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

Besides these, there's a lot of apples, pears, grapes, plums, cherries and even kiwis in private gardens. Some owners offer them for sale:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I1DYH11M26w/U_uFSm80ZpI/AAAAAAAAd5g/pUBuF-IkVpY/s1600/20140729_194831.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

It's a self-service counter, the buyer should leave the money in the rusty box down below.

However, the {{< fl "gratis" >}} fruits are just as good, which we've experimentally proven:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0hKpbI_xQ8/U_uFTupGG0I/AAAAAAAAd5w/uHmBguXt60c/s1600/20140824_192312.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

The pie is made of apples picked in a nearby grove.

A humble town-hall building is also in the old part. It has a clock-tower with a bunch of bells:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9DQ6wTGhjxc/U_uK-XSrAkI/AAAAAAAAfA0/_wSZl6tR3-o/s1600/dsc06379.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

A fountain, which is… uhm… a symbol of a mandatory fountain before the town-hall building:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7AoOenq6f9c/U_uK_lDiBYI/AAAAAAAAfBA/ggiNUeQGMJc/s1600/dsc06382.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

Modern technologies in the old town: the Dutch love to invest in *sustainable*, hence the solar panels. Not only is it subsidised by the government, but also reduces your electricity bill:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cdOZQGzTyco/U_uLTUK8TqI/AAAAAAAAfIk/p4RzVcOy5iE/s1600/dsc06428.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

The oldest spot in the town, {{< fl "Oude Dorp" >}} ("Old Village"), is a tiny square that looks completely authentic:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AOPNFtuA300/U_uLYDla6hI/AAAAAAAAfIk/NW_jIimWv1g/s1600/dsc06439.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

Apart from restaurants and shops, there's a traditional belfry next to it:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-InkyEYjO-tM/U_uLYXZ-CII/AAAAAAAAfGA/rJ5RpjaQefE/s1600/dsc06441.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

And a church:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v12Cl9s2U60/U_uLYnnkdPI/AAAAAAAAfIk/RYklwynZXDk/s1600/dsc06442.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

You can find the same setting in any Dutch settlement.

## Young Houten {#young}

Architecture of the new part is sometimes different, but you can always tell the new buildings by the exterior walls:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UGfefFXU26A/U_uLNWPet4I/AAAAAAAAfDs/7v1tkbmb18s/s1600/dsc06415.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

I'm particularly fond of those yellowish bricks, which resemble houses in [southern Belgium]({{< relref path="0035" lang="ru" >}}):
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--l9cDMEGSYM/U_uLOD9iRUI/AAAAAAAAfIk/rGAc_v46UIY/s1600/dsc06417.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

One of the eye-catchers of the new part is the three-wing pyramid called {{< fl "Het Domein" >}} ("The Domain"), the "hill-house" ({{< fl "heuvelgebouw" >}}) built in 2002 based on the design of {{< wiki "Robbert_en_Rudolf_Das" "nl" "Das brothers" >}}:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HKIgcg7oMTE/U_uLJ-29-LI/AAAAAAAAfIk/QybmmHbl5NI/s1600/dsc06407.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

Each apartment has a terrace, all of them together forming the pyramid:
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lz03s8LnRPs/U_uLKWDo39I/AAAAAAAAfC8/6bAzN_pJEo4/s1600/dsc06408.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

Most of the apartments located right above the water:
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OpNRV_WBoeY/U_uLI_0CO3I/AAAAAAAAfCc/byM0RrDg1sE/s1600/dsc06404.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

The nearby city beach on the {{< fl "Rietplas" >}} pool is not overly crowded in August. The little island on the left is only accessible via a shallow wade (which is about two feet deep):
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w1Bqjc8eDs4/U_uLFQjLkMI/AAAAAAAAfIk/GZEgD9x80-k/s1600/dsc06397.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

These kids are fortunate enough to possess a {{< fl "fluisterboot" >}} (electric boat):
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c_Ds9MHxsRk/U_uLGY81RbI/AAAAAAAAfCM/4I1xEWSyfwY/s1600/dsc06400.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

The pool is surrounded by houses, which must be pretty damp inside I think:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3RlIrmzre-0/U_uLHR4T5YI/AAAAAAAAfCU/DiQ3Uy08VCM/s1600/dsc06402.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

This block of toy-like houses is built right above the water surface:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SoP5ALHplJY/U_uLJnkcC3I/AAAAAAAAfIk/h5rtZGSzzZQ/s1600/dsc06406.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

In the medieval times the border of the Roman Empire lay here. This is reflected, for example, in the name of the {{< fl "Houten Castellum" >}} [train station]({{< relref "0221" >}}). All the streets in this neighbourhood have Italian names:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qxGHQtBW4Fg/U_uLPgLMWPI/AAAAAAAAfEM/HwrDsdY2jYg/s1600/dsc06421.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

{{< fl "Piazza" >}} means "square" in Italian.

These new houses are splendid in my opinion:
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Oo65uVvff0A/U_uLW-aUc_I/AAAAAAAAfFw/C4z3sPA5Wy0/s1600/dsc06420.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

And, of course, a good deal of them are erected on water:
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hg59fFU9uhU/U_uLQ8rYeUI/AAAAAAAAfIk/cc0ze_Z4SdM/s1600/dsc06423.picasaweb.jpg" >}}
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ji3ASVoVffM/VAwoI9bZssI/AAAAAAAAfaw/fQJ4lXhPyKU/s1600/dsc06650.picasaweb.jpg" >}}

That's about all I have to say about my current residence. In my next posts I'll tell you more about *house-hunt*.
