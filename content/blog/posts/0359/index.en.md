{{< a "https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=SoundSwitcherIndicator" "JetBrains" >}}, the maker of the most intelligent and versatile IDEs (*IDEA*, *WebStorm*, *PyCharm*, and others), has recognised my humble contribution to open-source software in the form of the {{< a "/software/sound-switcher-indicator" "Sound Switcher Indicator" >}}, and kindly granted me a free **All Products Pack** license.

A license is always issued for one year, with a possible extension should the project still qualify for their {{< a "https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/?from=SoundSwitcherIndicator" "OS Support Program" >}} requirements.

Thanks JetBrains!

On a side note, I'm still using Vim for simple stuff like shell scripts and Markdown, however it's really not up-to-par when it comes to complex projects with many dependencies. Refactorings with Vim, for one, have always been a pain.
