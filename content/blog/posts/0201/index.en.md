The application indicator for Ubuntu called [Sound Switcher Indicator][route:/software/indicator-sound-switcher] (which I [blogged]({{< relref "0178" >}}) about) has been updated to version **1.1.1**. There's no new functionality in this release, its main purpose is to make the indicator work in Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander). It was broken because of a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glipper/+bug/1203888) in `libdbusmenu`.

The new version makes use of GTK+ 3 and the trendy GObject Introspection (GIRepository). You can [install][route:/software/indicator-sound-switcher] it, as usual, from my [Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~yktooo/+archive/ppa/).

And, as usual, a picture just to draw your attention:
