Five days ago the mighty {{< intref "/tags/Arjen-Lucassen" "Arjen Lucassen" >}} [has announced](https://www.facebook.com/ArjenLucassenOfficial/videos/10153840917141152/) on his Facebook page two live shows of his *Ayreon* mega-project, which got the name [Ayreon Universe](http://www.arjenlucassen.com/universe/). The shows were scheduled for **15 and 16 September 2017**, with the official ticket sale starting on 24 November at 10:00 CET.

He also invited the fans to subscribe to the project's mailing list (something I've failed to spot on time). Those who did would have received a link to pre-sale that would allow them to buy tickets one day earlier.

But the concert organisers have underestimated the zealotry of Ayreon's fans.

According to Arjen, both shows (**6000** tickets in total) have been [sold out](https://www.facebook.com/ArjenLucassenOfficial/posts/10153847922071152) in less than a day, that is, even before the public sale went open. Furthermore, tickets for the Saturday show (16 September) [were gone](https://www.facebook.com/ArjenLucassenOfficial/photos/a.114351896151.107682.109887886151/10153846039016152/) in less than an hour. They had to urgently arrange an additional concert on **17 September**.

I was to late for the mailing list, but still fortunate enough to have bought a ticket for this additional show. Which, by the way, has been sold out yesterday, too.

So, a total of **9000** tickets was done with in [less than 48 hours](https://www.facebook.com/ArjenLucassenOfficial/videos/10153850665491152/). The shows will take place at [013](http://www.013.nl/), Tilburg.

## Why the fuss? {#lineup}
