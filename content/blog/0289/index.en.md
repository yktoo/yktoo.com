The website **yktoo.com** is permanently switched to using the secure [HTTPS][wiki:en:HTTPS] protocol (instead of the former [HTTP][wiki:en:HTTPS]). Your boss won't be able to figure out what exactly you're reading in my blog anymore.

There's an automatic redirect set up from **http://yktoo.com** to **https://yktoo.com**, but you may still need to update some links, like the [RSS feeds][route:/blog/subscribe], for example.
