I'm just back from Amersfoort where I've quite successfully finished a half marathon, **21.1 km**.

The day's been a scorcher with 27 °C (81 °F) in the shade. On the Dutch scale it's a lot, and with a clear blue sky you feel like being roasted.

It was a significant improvement compared to the [previous time][post:274]: **1:55:04** versus **2:01:46** (five minutes faster), but then the gale was making running difficult. Also my regular trainings have paid off—these days I routinely run twenty kilometres.

In the result [table](http://nl.mylaps.com/evenementen/uitslagen/2016/jun/5/amersfoort/HalfTot.html) I've been assigned the **343<sup>th</sup>** place out of 1222 overall, **303<sup>th</sup>** out of 884 among men. Much better than the previous one where I finished the 730<sup>th</sup>. And among residents of Houten I was the third!

It was almost as many people this time.

On the other side of the start line:

The first to start were two "wheelers":

It was quite crowded, but the organisation was very good.

Everyone who reached the finish was given a medal (on the photo above), a water bottle and a 500 gram bucket of Campina yoghurt (they were the main sponsors of the marathon).

Despite the heat I loved the run. Running is fun, so join in!
