Now that October has come, the summer is finally here. The last time it visited us was [in April][post:92]. After that I couldn't say we ever had summer weather in the past months. Temperature would hardly rise above 21—22° C (70—72° F), and mainly kept around 16—18° C (61—64° F), especially during August and September.

But the last two days of September happened to be really warm, and on the first of October temperature soared [to 26° C](http://www.knmi.nl/climatology/daily_data/index.cgi?station=260&year=2011&month=10&day=01) (79° F) again.

What else could one do on such a lazy Saturday than simply go to the coast?

So I'm in [the Hague][post:79] again. Scheveningen. The coast is crowded. October 1st.

Bars in the neighbourhood are full as well. Waiters have to work hard.

A warning for the customers hangs at a snack bar: "Beware of seagulls" ("Pas op voor de meeuwen"):

And the seagulls are vigilant and always nearby, watching the unmindful customers from above:

The sky is amazingly blue, and sailboats at the horizon fade out in the haze:

Not many swim, but some do. Water is at my feeling about fifteen degrees centigrade (59° F):

I couldn't resist the temptation to have a swim. For the first time I saw a jelly-fish here in the North Sea!

In such a heat even robots undress and tend to have a glass of cocktail:
