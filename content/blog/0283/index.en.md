I've finally nerved myself to tell you about a sad development for prog lovers.

I first learned about the Dutch prog band *Sun Caged* when I came to Holland back in 2008. Shortly after I've even seen them playing on [Walhalla]({{< relref path="/blog/0022" lang="ru" >}}). I must say I was impressed. But three years later, in 2011, the band has released {{< wiki "The_Lotus_Effect" "en" "The Lotus Effect" >}} (which also happened to be their last album), I was totally blown away as this was absolutely a masterpiece of progressive metal. I can't even explain why, but I deem this album one of the best rock works ever, and I seem to be able to listen to it endlessly.

But nothing lasts forever. I reckon the band has had a bumpy ride, which is none too uncommon considering personalities of creative people.

The American singer *Paul Adrian Villarreal* has decided to return to his homeland, the USA. Which meant *Sun Caged* had to disband.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L3-s4NiT2L4/V1RAFo8gHeI/AAAAAAAAmVw/ufBrvACf9NYhNpMgM9x7M2HwMILFivwJQCKgB/s1600/dsc02329.picasaweb.jpg" "Paul Villarreal." >}}

Another important point is that he also wrote all the lyrics, and it is impressive. I doubt a non-native English speaker would be up to something like this:

> Standing by the water's edge<br>
> And weighing all my options<br>
> To leave behind what has brought me ashore<br>
> Trying in vain to hedge<br>
> Whispering a word of caution<br>
> The raft is swept to sea forever more…<br>
> <br>
> (Make me believe it's not make-believe incentive to justify all of this longing inside)<br>
> <br>
> …And you're still there, tearfully I wave farewell<br>
> Our paths divide, no use to hide our despair<br>
> <br>
> (Hallucinated protection, Natural Parasol, save us all from despair)<br>

So on May 20, 2016 *Sun Caged* has hit the stage for the last time. The gig was [held](http://www.debosuil.nl/Definition/Details/586965/588540/9197_sun-caged-farewell-show.aspx) in the club [De Bosuil](http://www.debosuil.nl/), situated in the Dutch town of {{< wiki "Weert" "en" "Weert" >}}.

The club was pretty small, and so was the audience. I'd say fifty people at most.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Zvv31vD_yDg/V1RAFizgr4I/AAAAAAAAmVw/EySxsG8VjAIia2_unOTSJPVkZMG4cST4QCKgB/s1600/dsc02330.picasaweb.jpg" "Audience." >}}

And for that you can arguably blame the very remote location and the ungodly hour: the show started at 20:30, whereas the headliners began to play around 23:00. As to why they decided to have it there, perhaps because most of the band's members live in the vicinity of Weert.

On the other hand, I can't complain—I could easily take my place right next to the stage.

There were also two support acts: *Marcel Coenen & Friends* and *The Barstool Philosophers*, both featuring Paul on some songs.

## Marcel Coenen & Friends {#marcel-coenen-friends}

{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bzFGicJUVWY/V1RAFnfGiwI/AAAAAAAAmVw/93NQnzXTcBAPJAEYamq6JdFBdEBNKjZlwCKgB/s1600/dsc02299.picasaweb.jpg" "Marcel Coenen & Friends." >}}

The name of the band speaks for itself: it's formed around the guitarist [Marcel Coenen](http://marcelcoenen.com/), who also played in *Sun Caged*.
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8nlyrAvXaFE/V1RAFswobOI/AAAAAAAAmVw/nt2ovnT3NZgmky2VC042fx6RzZn9KYZwACKgB/s1600/dsc02304.picasaweb.jpg" "Marcel Coenen." >}}

Since I saw him [last time]({{< relref path="/blog/0022" lang="ru" >}}) he has clearly grown, both in proficiency and in size.

The band also features another *Sun Caged* member, the keyboardist *Rene Kroon*.
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6j8YU5zoBRg/V1RAFvhm7AI/AAAAAAAAmVw/6k3LTHLpIUkA8jhry8VB3aDGq4s4WprmACKgB/s1600/dsc02317.picasaweb.jpg" "Rene Kroon." >}}

The drummer [Hans in 't Zandt](http://www.hansintzandt.nl/):
{{< imgfig "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IU8bk_ThHOM/V1RAFgy9dOI/AAAAAAAAmVw/J2NQI-yo4qA0iRvoYx5CxU7Bo9t4kejAwCKgB/s1600/dsc02310.picasaweb.jpg" "Hans in 't Zandt." >}}

The music is [quite interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liZWxAxXN0k) at times, but to me it's clear it's all glued by the wizardry of Marcel. The band's style can be described as mainstream rock a-la Yngwie Malmsteen with a touch of fusion. The other guitarist *Freek Gielen* is also quite [capable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04CaVtrPDmo), yet you don't notice much of that when he's with the band.

Here's them frolicly shredding *New Race*, joined by the ex-member guitarist *Frank Schiphorst*:
{{< youtube "4BCEgxzFmzg" >}}

Another, this time quite complicated, tune called *Patron Saint* with Paul doing vocals:
{{< youtube "ijzlCffkp6I" >}}

At last I made a photo of their set-list:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-he3NQj1r7Ks/V1RAFhBhOqI/AAAAAAAAmVw/HHYtOrEv1v4Obn4s02CLAaIwwK72XdynwCKgB/s1600/20160520_225519.picasaweb.jpg" "Set-list of Marcel Coenen & Friends." >}}

## The Barstool Philosophers {#the-barstool-philosophers}

This lot didn't really move me. I believe there's quite some room to grow (practice?), also the way they behave on-stage isn't very inspiring. Even the presence of Rene Kroon doesn't contribute much.
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hd7w7Uk9HUs/V1RAFq88b6I/AAAAAAAAmVw/fb_9C-mDp7soo6z_Ux4TQhapJHCPCh4YACKgB/s1600/dsc02337.picasaweb.jpg" "The Barstool Philosophers." >}}

## Sun Caged {#sun-caged}

And, finally, on to my primary target.
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YFflUBKVjk4/V1RAFis-QaI/AAAAAAAAmVw/VlH4UxRPu6c0MorP2tTtaev4iyGAJnlowCKgB/s1600/20160520_230531.picasaweb.jpg" "Before the show." >}}

I can't express how heart-broken I am at the fact the band doesn't exist anymore. It's even more upsetting the guys, given all their apparent professionalism, never became known well enough. I sense it could have influenced their decision to disband, too, although that would all be guesswork. Unfortunately I didn't manage to find any recent information or interview with the band.

But curiously, in an [almost ten-year-old interview](http://www.sevenstring.org/forum/showpost.php?p=473698&postcount=1), on the question about where he sees himself in ten years time, Marcel Coenen says:

> [In] ten years I hope to tour the world with Sun Caged and have a big solo career.

Well, some dreams never come true.

The entire show was filmed with a number of professional cameras (including one constantly aimed at Marcel).
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MjeOoLTh8Qc/V1RAFu_xV3I/AAAAAAAAmU8/FMaXrjc_8rQGBkA3LAMBEYGyanvt5jlhwCKgB/s1600/dsc02394.picasaweb.jpg" "Marcel Coenen." >}}

As I was told, the video will be released in Ultra HD (then I can finally make use of [4K in my TV]({{< relref "/blog/0243" >}})). In the meantime you can enjoy somewhat less professional, yet equally impressing material of my own making.

Another challenge for the band was that the bassist *Daniel Kohn* had some health issues not so long before the show, so he was replaced by *Arnold-Dimitry Rerimassie*.
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z3yFciIJIhE/V1RAFrffHVI/AAAAAAAAmVw/VZZ1KQBKXhs8prdcKQmtY-MYHj51uN87gCKgB/s1600/dsc02383.picasaweb.jpg" "Marcel Coenen and Arnold-Dimitry Rerimassie." >}}

Daniel was also virtually present on Skype:
{{< imgfig "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_49MgiysNIs/V1RAFiZTS2I/AAAAAAAAmVw/Cvzx3rZtlWkdtwoKFrUBZgNpG5QQz_djwCKgB/s1600/dsc02368.picasaweb.jpg" "Daniel Kohn on Skype." >}}

Bass tracks by *Sun Caged* are darn sophisticated at times, there's also a number of solo spots. Considering the short lead time, Arnold-Dimitry did a fantastic job; however for me, knowing it all down to a single note, it was sometimes pretty far from the original.
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KLU20IZcrSg/V1RAFmu78TI/AAAAAAAAmVw/QxOGQUIhMrwHhjV4qSEiowzGGD2JuAVoQCKgB/s1600/dsc02392.picasaweb.jpg" "Marcel Coenen and Arnold-Dimitry Rerimassie." >}}

In another [interview](http://ytsejam.com/2011/06/interview-with-paul-adrian-villarreal-marcel-coenen-sun-caged/) recorded shortly after the release of {{< wiki "The_Lotus_Effect" "en" "The Lotus Effect" >}}, Paul explains that the whole album was composed in the rehearsal room and by all members. Also *Engelbert the Inchworm* and *Departing Words* from the previous album {{< wiki "Artemisia_(album)" "en" "Artemisia" >}} were conceived in that way. Having read that, I was surprised as exactly those I deemed their best works.
{{< imgfig "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W75YkI0JHYY/V1RAFi8V0LI/AAAAAAAAmVw/hBOGd9NQLyw0e5WCx9vA14entnUKrBmywCKgB/s1600/dsc02360.picasaweb.jpg" "Paul Adrian Villarreal." >}}

Back to the gig, the band has played tracks from all three albums, starting with *Sun Caged* from the same-named one:
{{< youtube "C9P1ejVlaIQ" >}}

*A Fair Trade* from the second release *Artemisia*:
{{< youtube "h9CrxmSEhyw" >}}

And, at last, my favourites, *The Lotus Effect*. *Shades of Hades*:
{{< youtube "ztPR67BBePk" >}}

*Reductio Ad Absurdum*:
{{< youtube "HSjpdIu04P4" >}}

The track *Ashes to Earn* is linked to a funny incident. Once the album was out, many websites got its name wrong: *Ashes to Ear*. In fact, its name accounts for the similarity of *earn* and *urn* (and definitely not *ear*).
{{< youtube "IUEwz8j6vOY" >}}

But the biggest hit was the already mentioned *Departing Words*, featuring *PV Bhaskar* on {{< wiki "Mridangam" "en" "mridangam" >}} and *Barend Tromp* on {{< wiki "Sitar" "en" "sitar" >}}. Seeing is believing so please enjoy:
{{< youtube "0LM_u3quaZs" >}}

For encore the band has played the 24 minute long *Ashtamangala*, but unfortunately my camera ran out of juice by then. We'll see it on a DVD anyway.

That's about it, end of an era. The show was done with, and so was the band. The final appearance:
{{< imgfig "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GUTz-jqDsaY/V1RAFoao31I/AAAAAAAAmU8/QTHzwwjnqqAysQOhudfV7pNTtPDZjeNDACKgB/s1600/dsc02422.picasaweb.jpg" "Final appearance." >}}

That's kind of a break-up year: first *Sun Caged*, later I learned *Stream of Passion* are also disbanding (the last show will be played at the end of this year).
