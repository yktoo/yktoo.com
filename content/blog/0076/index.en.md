Now that spring has come, we have daffodils flowering! Not so many and yet remarkable:

I've no clue what these are:

I think there are not so many because it's still cool, around 8-10Â° C.

But Amesrfoort has the Great Unknown instead:

Ducks at the pond rushed to me when I came to photograph them, obviously hoping for bread. Sorry guys, that's not going to happen:

They did look disappointed at me.

My orchid is blooming as well. Spring!
