**DKLang Translation Editor** is a GUI application for editing [DKLang Localization Package]({{< relref "/software/dklang-localization-package" >}}) translations.

## Features

* Translation using a dictionary (so-called *Translation Repository*).
* Automatic tracking of source and translation mismatches. A difference log is generated when you open a project. This log shows you added and deleted entries as compared to the language source file. New entries can then be automatically translated with the Translation Repository.
* An extra translation file for displaying strings can be used. For example, when you translate into Ukrainian it would be more convenient to use Russian as a reference rather than English, given a Russian translation is already available.
* Find and Replace functions.
* Any item in the translation tree can be bookmarked and navigated to later.
