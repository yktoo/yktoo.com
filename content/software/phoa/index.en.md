## Features

* Support for a multitude of image formats.
* Rich picture organisation capabilities:
    * You create a group (folder) structure, where any picture can belong to any number of groups. This is very similar to what is called <i>tags</i> in other programs.
    * Each group can have a custom icon.
    * Each picture can have a number of properties defined. These properties are: date, time, place (location), film properties, author, short and long description, media name.
    * Additionally to all of the above, each picture can be assigned any number of keywords.
* It's blazing fast! Thanks to in-memory processing all the operations are near-instantaneous.
* Advanced picture viewer that can display any properties on top of the image. Slideshow mode.
* Advanced search capabilities. PhoA even has a special query language for pictures.
* Any action, except file operations, can be undone.
* Multimonitor support.
* Support for portable installations. You can copy the program, the photo album and all the picture files to a CD or a USB stick.
* And last but not least: completely documented!
