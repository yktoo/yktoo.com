## About me

Hello there. My name is Dmitry Kann (Cyrillic: {{< fl "Дмитрий Канн" >}}). I was born and bred in Russia, but in **2008** I've moved to the Netherlands, which became my new home. I live in a beautiful town called [Houten]({{< relref "0221" >}}).

I'm a software developer and the founder of a small software company called [Yktoo Solutions](https://yktoo.solutions).

I have a number of hobbies to fill up my spare time: [blogging][route:/site/index], open-source [software development][route:/software/index], [music][route:/blog/tag,tag:music], [travelling][route:/blog/tag,tag:travel], [aikido][route:/blog/tag,tag:aikido] and [running][route:/blog/tag,tag:running]. And in the past being a part of the [Radiolaria][route:/radiolaria/index] duo.
