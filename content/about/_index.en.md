## About me

Hello there. My name is Dmitry Kann (Cyrillic: {{< fl "Дмитрий Канн" >}}). I was born and bred in Russia, but in **2008** I've moved to the Netherlands, which became my new home. I live in a beautiful town called {{< a "0221" "Houten" >}}.

I'm a software developer and the founder of a small software company called [Yktoo Solutions](https://yktoo.solutions).

I have a number of hobbies to fill up my spare time: {{< a "/" "blogging" >}}, open-source {{< a "/software" "software development" >}}, {{< a "/tags/music" "music" >}}, {{< a "/tags/travel" "travelling" >}}, {{< a "/tags/aikido" "aikido" >}} and {{< a "/tags/running" "running" >}}. And in the past being a part of the {{< a "/radiolaria" "Radiolaria" >}} duo.

I speak Russian, English, and Dutch. If you feel like contacting me, check out the {{< a "/about/contact" "Contact" >}} page.
