## About me

Hello there. My name is Dmitry Kann (Cyrillic: {{< fl "Дмитрий Канн" >}}). I was born and bred in Russia, but in **2008** I've moved to the Netherlands, which became my new home. I live in a beautiful town called {{< intref "0221" "Houten" >}}.

I'm a software developer and the founder of a small software company called [Yktoo Solutions](https://yktoo.solutions).

I have a number of hobbies to fill up my spare time: {{< intref "/" "blogging" >}}, open-source {{< intref "/software" "software development" >}}, {{< intref "/tags/music" "music" >}}, {{< intref "/tags/travel" "travelling" >}}, {{< intref "/tags/aikido" "aikido" >}} and {{< intref "/tags/running" "running" >}}. And in the past being a part of the {{< intref "/radiolaria" "Radiolaria" >}} duo.

I speak Russian, English, and Dutch. If you feel like contacting me, check out the {{< intref "/about/contact" "Contact" >}} page.
