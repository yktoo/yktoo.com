## About me

Hello there. My name is Dmitry Kann (Cyrillic: {{< fl "Дмитрий Канн" >}}). I was born and bred in Russia, but in **2008** I've moved to the Netherlands, which became my new home. I live in a beautiful town called [Houten]({{< relref "0221" >}}).

I'm a software developer and the founder of a small software company called [Yktoo Solutions](https://yktoo.solutions).

I have a number of hobbies to fill up my spare time: [blogging]({{< relref "/" >}}), open-source [software development]({{< relref "/software" >}}), [music]({{< relref "/tags/music" >}}), [travelling]({{< relref "/tags/travel" >}}), [aikido]({{< relref "/tags/aikido" >}}) and [running]({{< relref "/tags/running" >}}). And in the past being a part of the [Radiolaria]({{< relref "/radiolaria" >}}) duo.
